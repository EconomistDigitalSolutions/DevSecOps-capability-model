## About this Capability Model

This capability model was derived, influenced and inspired by:

[Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim), [Jez Humble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble) and [Dr. Nicole Forsgren](https://twitter.com/nicolefv) via the books:
- [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1942788762)
- [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1942788339)

Thanks to [Timo Pagel](https://github.com/wurstbrot) for the [DevSecOps maturity project](https://dsomm.timo-pagel.de/index.php) which was the original stimulus for this project.

Props to [Nadieh Bremer](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242) for the original Radar D3.js code.

## How to use

Look at the Principles matrix and read the questions, based on your answers to the questions you can give yourself a score for that principle.
Simply fork the project and modify the `data/tableData.json` and change the team names and scores to model your organisation. Or even add your own principles to model your organisations capability needs.
