title: About DevSecOps Capability Model

## Capability Model

Use this capability model to map where you are on the DevSecOps journey.

Look at the principles matrix and read the questions, based on your answers to the questions and score yourself for that principle.
Simply fork the project and modify the `data/tableData.json` and change the team names and scores to model your organisation. Or even add your own principles to model your organisations capability needs.

## DevSecOps

Why the **Sec** in Dev**Sec**Ops? For the last two years the industry has been pushing to shift elements of security (in particular AppSec and CloudSec ) as left as possible. It turns out that DevOps enfranchised teams are well placed to do this work.
