title: About DevSecOps Capability Model

## Why DevOps

Since almost every company today relies on software, software delivery performance is a critical lever that a company has to improve organisational performance.

## How do you improve at DevOps?

As you can see from the image below from the [Google State of DevOps report 2019](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling) it is quite evident how much elite performers (Level 4) perform better than low performers (Level 1)

Use this capability model to map where you are on the DevSecOps journey and then drive and monitor change in maturity.

### How to use

Look at the principles matrix and read the questions, based on your answers to the questions and score yourself for that principle.
Simply fork the project and modify the `data/data.json` and change the team names and scores to model your organisation. Or even add your own principles to model your organisations capability needs.

## DevSecOps

Why the **Sec** in Dev**Sec**Ops? For the last two years the industry has been pushing to shift elements of security (in particular AppSec and CloudSec ) as left as possible. It turns out that DevOps enfranchised teams are well placed to do this work.
